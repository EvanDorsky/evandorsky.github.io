Hi! I'm Evan.

I'm an [engineer, educator] based in San Francisco.

I study how technology functions as a structuring force – an environment – in the subjective experience of individuals and in society at large. _I leverage my **first-hand experience as an engineer at Apple and other tech companies**{:#apple-spg .key-phrase}_{:.apple-spg-line .key-line} to ground my study in an understanding of how technology works, and how it actually gets built in industry.

I draw on my **experience as an educator**{:#olin-js .key-phrase} to lead **book clubs, reading groups, and seminars**{:#practical-ee .key-phrase}{:.olin-js-line .practical-ee-line .key-line} exploring the embedding of ethics in technology.
