Hi! I'm Evan.

I'm a [musician, photographer, engineer] based in San Francisco.

I'm currently the violist in the [Cable Car Quartet](/music){:target="_blank" .key-phrase}, a team member at [Photo Laundry](https://www.instagram.com/photolaundrysf/){:target="_blank" .key-phrase}, and a senior systems integration engineer at [SPAN](https://www.span.io){:target="_blank" .key-phrase}. In 2023 I was a cohort leader for the fall offering of Stanford's [ Ethics, Technology + Public Policy for Practitioners](https://online.stanford.edu/courses/soe-xetech0001-ethics-technology-public-policy-practitioners){:target="_blank" .key-phrase}.

I am interested in how technology functions as a structuring force – an environment – in the subjective experience of individuals and in society at large. _I leverage my **first-hand experience as an engineer at Apple and other tech companies**{:#industry .key-phrase}_{:.industry-line .key-line} to ground my explorations in an understanding of how technology works, and how it actually gets built in industry.

_I draw on my **experience as an educator**{:#teaching .key-phrase} to lead **book clubs, reading groups, and seminars**{:#practical-ee .key-phrase}_{:.practical-ee-line .teaching-line .key-line} exploring the embedding of ethics in technology.
