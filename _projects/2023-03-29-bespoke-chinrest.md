The violin is not built to adapt nicely to the human body. So most modern violinists use adapters to ease the transition between body and instrument:
- a chinrest between the chin and the top of the instrument, and
- a shoulder rest between the bottom of the instrument and the shoulder.

Since every violinist's body is different, every violinist requires different rests. Typically, shoulder rests are adjustable and chinrests are not.

Over two decades playing violin, I've used countless chinrests. Storebought ones of different heights, mount points, angles, materials... plus my own contraptions from sponges, friction material, cloth, etc.

Nothing has really worked for me. So I thought I'd make my own.

I made a scan of myself holding my violin in playing position with my head in a natural, comfortable position. I took the mesh into Blender, pulled out the vertices I needed, and brought those into Onshape, a CAD program. In Onshape, I angled the mesh and adapted it to a post that would fit into a chinrest mount I already had. I exported an STL, sliced it with PrusaSlicer, and printed the design on my Prusa MINI+ 3D printer.

The resulting object, printed in translucent green, adapts to the instrument.

It is not a very good chinrest right now... but this is just iteration one.
