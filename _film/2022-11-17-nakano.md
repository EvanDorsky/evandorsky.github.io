Just west of Shinjuku is Nakano, one of the most densely populated [special wards of Tokyo](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Special_wards_of_Tokyo).

I took the train there in the morning to do some camera shopping.

This market opened right onto the street, and to a short covered walkway to the train station. In Tokyo, train infrastructure and city infrastructure are deeply and thoughtfully intertwined, inseparable.

The camera shops were down the neighboring alleys.

The alleys embodied the busy, joyful, dense, layered vertical vibrance that makes Tokyo such a pleasure to explore.
