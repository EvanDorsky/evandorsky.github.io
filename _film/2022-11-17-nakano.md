In the morning I took the train to Nakano Station as I had read there was good camera shopping there.

This covered market opened right onto the street, and to a short covered walkway that connected to the train station. In Tokyo, train infrastructure and city infrastructure are deeply and thoughtfully intertwined, inseparable.

The alleys embodied the busy, joyful, dense, layered vertical vibrance that makes Tokyo such a pleasure to explore.
