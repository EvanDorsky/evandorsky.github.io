These images are from the first roll of C41 film I developed at home. I used the [CS41 "Color Simplified" 2-bath liquid concentrate 1 quart kit from CineStill](https://cinestillfilm.com/products/cs41-simplified-color-processing-at-home-quart-kit-c-41-chemistry?variant=30376678593), purchased at [Glass Key Photo](https://www.glasskeyphoto.com) in San Francisco. After the negatives dried – much to my excitement, they were appropriately dense with a clear base, clean, and flat – I scanned them on my Epson Perfection V750 flatbed scanner and inverted the scans with [Negative Lab Pro](https://www.negativelabpro.com).

I took a walk around my neighborhood to capture these images. I think I was on my way to drop off a package at the UPS store – but mostly I was eager to shoot a roll so I could test my new chemicals and process.
