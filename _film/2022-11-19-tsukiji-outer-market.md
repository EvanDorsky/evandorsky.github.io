Out of the station, we were led by our mapping apps past a wide open area. We figured this is where the wholesale "inner market" of Tsukiji market used to be. It was moved to a nearby manmade island in 2018.

Before long the retail "outer market" greeted us with a flurry of color and activity.

It was barely noon but the sun was already at a low angle, to set by half past four.

One stand had burned down recently â€“ so recently that people were coming and going, evidently assessing the damage and seeing what could be salvaged. The whole operation was quiet and orderly, and business continued as usual on either side.
