Hi! I'm Evan.
<br>
<br>

(Bio)

I spent 2016-19 working in the **Apple Special Projects Group**{:#apple-spg .key-phrase} as a sensor hardware integration engineer.

Between then and April 2021, I built the software stack from the ground up for **Perceptive Sensing**{:#perceptive .key-phrase}, a small startup in the autonomous vehicle space.

I graduated with a BS ECE from **Olin College**{:#olin .key-phrase} in 2016.

> While I was there, I **designed and taught a course**{:#olin-js .key-phrase} on web development with five fellow student instructors, **served as a teaching assistant**{:#ninja .key-phrase} for five other engineering courses, and **taught a mini course**{:#practical-ee .key-phrase} on introductory electrical engineering concepts.

> I also (on student teams) **designed an integrated circuit**{:#madvlsi .key-phrase} with my team's faces on it, **built a real arcade game cabinet**{:#spaceteam .key-phrase} based on a smartphone game about yelling, and **designed and built a prototype power outlet faceplate**{:#ivani-scope .key-phrase} that monitors electricity usage [US10627253B2].

> In 2015, I worked in the **Apple Accessories**{:#apple-acc .key-phrase} group validating new silicon and product prototypes.

> In 2014, I led an effort to bring a mechanical energy harvester from proof-of-concept to functioning prototype at **FastCap Ultracapacitors**{:#fastcap .key-phrase}.

> In 2013, I built the product for **playposit**{:#playposit .key-phrase}, a video-based EdTech startup.
