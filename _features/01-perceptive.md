*My team*{:.drop-cap}
of eight (the entire company) was building a novel autonomous vehicle sensor solution from scratch. [They still are](https://www.perceptivesensing.ai).

*My work*{:.drop-cap}
was to build out all the software tools required by our system. I wrote the full stack, from binary data parsing to dynamic coloring for visualizers displaying millions of 3D points. I chose [ROS](https://www.ros.org/about-ros/) as the defining framework.
