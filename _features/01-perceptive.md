*My team*{:.drop-cap}
of eight (the entire company) was building a novel autonomous vehicle sensor solution from scratch. [They still are](https://www.perceptivesensing.ai).

*My work*{:.drop-cap}
was to build out all the software tools required by our system. I wrote the full stack from binary data parsing to dynamic colors for visualizers displaying millions of 3D points. The stack was organized as a computational graph built in [ROS](https://www.ros.org/about-ros/), which I learned along the way.
