*My team*{:.drop-cap}
was a startup in an EdTech accelerator program – two cofounders, me, and another engineer who left three weeks after I started. Our product was an E-Learning platform designed for the [flipped classroom](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Flipped_classroom). The platform allowed teachers to turn an existing internet video into a lesson for their students by adding "checks for understanding" (multiple choice questions, short answers, etc.) that would pop up at times of their choosing as the video played.

*My work*{:.drop-cap}
was to build the product based on the founders' vision and their Alpha version. I

- Worked with the founders to turn product requirements into a system design and ultimately a [RESTful API](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Representational_state_transfer) architecture
- Built most of the backend – [PHP](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/PHP) and [MySQL](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/MySQL) – including user auth and password reset
- Built the frontend with [Backbone.js](https://backbonejs.org) and [CSS](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/CSS)

We finished the Beta in time for the school year (and the end-of-accelerator demo), and [PlayPosit](https://go.playposit.com) continues on.
