For a mixed analog/digital integrated circuit design (MAD VLSI) class final project, my team of three designed a 2-channel (stereo) audio amplifier with gain tunable via [SPI](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Serial_Peripheral_Interface). We all collaborated on the design, and I completed schematic capture and layout for the digital circuit.

Integrated circuit design takes place below the transistor level. Transistors are created out of overlapping metal and semiconductor layers which are deposited onto Silicon wafers and etched to form patterns. We specified the dimensions of each transistor according to its function: digital (low power) transistors were small, analog (high power) transistors were large and wide.

Through a [MOSIS](https://www.mosis.com) program, we had our design fabricated, and what's shown here is a picture of the real die (about 1 mm square). Since our design only took up about a quarter of the die, we filled the empty space with pictures of ourselves.
