I joined a student teaching team to give the second offering of [Olin.js](https://github.com/olinjs/olinjs), a semester long for-credit course on full stack web development (in [node.js](https://nodejs.org/en/)). We created all the course materials and ran everything â€“ we gave lectures, graded assignments, held office hours, etc.


Our ~25 students (fellow Olin College students) started the semester with some programming experience, but little to no Javascript experience. By the end of the semester, they were working in teams building real web apps using frameworks like [Angular](https://angularjs.org), [Ember](https://emberjs.com), and [React](https://reactjs.org) (all popular in 2015).
