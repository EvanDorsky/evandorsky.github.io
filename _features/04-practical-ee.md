During my senior year, I wanted to transfer some of the electrical engineering knowledge and practices I had gained from my time as a course assistant and in industry.

I led a small course attended by first- and second-year students covering best practices for solderless breadboards, lab equipment use (oscilloscopes and signal generators), op-amp circuits, and transistor basics.

Some of the course materials are still hosted [here](https://www.evandors.ky/ee-seminar).
