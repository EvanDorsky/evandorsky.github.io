*My team*{:.drop-cap}
was the Apple accessories hardware group.

*My work*{:.drop-cap}
revolved around Silicon validation for the USB-C to Lightning Cable and [Lightning to 3.5 mm Headphone Jack Adapter](https://www.ifixit.com/Teardown/Apple+Lightning+to+Headphone+Jack+Adapter+Teardown/67562). I become intimately familiar with the Lightning system architecture and wrote embedded C (with [mbed](https://os.mbed.com)) and Python to automate validation tests. I also designed a circuit board for further test automation.
