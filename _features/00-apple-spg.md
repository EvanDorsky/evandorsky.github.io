*My team*{:.drop-cap}
sat between the teams that delivered sensor modules and the teams that used them â€“ at least a dozen teams spread around the organization.

As sensor experts, we helped set requirements for the sensor system (like performance, size, power use) and worked with the sensor module teams to meet those requirements.

We designed procedures to make sure the sensors met requirements (testing and performance characterization), and manufacturing processes to make the sensor system ready for delivery (calibration and subassembly builds).

*My work*{:.drop-cap}
was a grab bag of hardware and software tasks. I

- Implemented factory calibration procedures for novel depth sensors
- Wrote software tools for interfacing with depth sensors which were widely used throughout the hardware organization
- Wrote software and automated hardware to achieve microsecond-precision timing characterization
- Designed circuit boards for calibration stations and sensor subassemblies
