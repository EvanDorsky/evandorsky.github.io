### Apple Special Projects - 2016-2019

I worked on cutting edge sensor hardware for autonomous systems at Apple. My team was responsible for integrating sensor modules (like cameras) into the overall system architecture, which required us to interface with over a dozen teams spread throughout the organizaiton.

My role was highly technical (designing circuit boards and high-precision measurement setups) and had tremendous interpersonal requirements (knowing how to get the right people into the room to reach a decision, balancing stakeholders with conflicting requirements). As a result, I gained deep knowledge of both the technical system we were building, and the structure and function of the organization.

### Perceptive Sensing - 2019-2021

I left Apple to pursue a technical environment where I could grow into greater ownership and responsibility. Perceptive Sensing was designing novel sensors for autonomous vehicles. As employee number six, I created the system architecture for the software drivers for our sensor system, and built and supported all the drivers and internal tools myself using the [ROS](https://www.ros.org/blog/why-ros/) robotics software framework.
