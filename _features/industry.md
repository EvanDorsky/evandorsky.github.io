### Apple Special Projects - 2016-2019

I worked on cutting edge sensor hardware for autonomous systems at Apple. My team was responsible for integrating sensor modules (like cameras) into the broader system. This work required us to interface with over a dozen teams spread throughout the organization, from mechanical design to AI.

My role was highly technical: I designed circuit boards and techniques for measuring properties of sensor systems with extremely high precision; I also traveled to factory settings to commission (set up and hand off) sensor test stations that I helped design.

My role also had a tremendous interpersonal component: I needed to know how to get the right people in the room to make a cross-functional decision, and how to balance situations where different stakeholders had conflicting requirements.

As a result, I gained deep knowledge of both the technical system we were building, and the structure and function of the organization.

### Perceptive Sensing - 2019-2021

I left Apple in 2019 to pursue a faster-paced environment where I could learn more and take on more responsibility.

Perceptive Sensing was building novel sensor hardware for autonomous vehicles. I joined as a founding software engineer, employee number six.

At Perceptive, I designed the system architecture for the sensor drivers (all the software that ran on the computer we plugged our sensors into). I also built most of the tools myself, ranging from high-bandwidth network data parsing to rich real-time visualizations of millions of Lidar points per second.
