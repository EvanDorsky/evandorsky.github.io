Over my time at Olin College I served as a "NINJA" (**N**eed **I**nformation **N**ow? **J**ust **A**sk! – Olin's term for course assistants) for introductory electrical engineering courses:

- Modeling and Control - circuits
- Real World Measurements - circuits for sensors
- Introduction to Sensors, Instrumentation, and Measurement

and more advanced courses:
- Principles of Engineering – mechatronic systems design and integration
- Controls – dynamic feedback control theory

As a NINJA I graded assignments, held office hours (which were generally well attended at Olin), and gave the occasional lecture. When class time was devoted to open work time, I was often available to answer questions. Olin has no graduate students, so NINJAs work closely with professors to ensure students have the resources they need to succeed.
