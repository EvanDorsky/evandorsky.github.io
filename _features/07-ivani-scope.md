My Engineering Capstone project team was sponsored by [Ivani](https://ivani.com), an IoT startup. Over the course of two semesters, we completed a full product cycle from market research to functional prototype build.

The product design we settled on was a power outlet faceplate with a wireless sensor for monitoring power use. The faceplate also leveraged Ivani's Bluetooth wireless stack to monitor the presence of people in rooms, track assets, and communicate with other faceplates via a mesh network.

After we demoed our prototype to Ivani, they decided to work with us to bring the invention to patent. The patent ([US10627253B2](https://patents.google.com/patent/US10627253B2/en)) reached utility in 2020.

Our custom printed circuit board (PCB) took AC power as input and converted it to 5V DC power. I designed and laid out the power and input protection circuits.
