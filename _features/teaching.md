I recieved my BSECE from Olin College in 2016.

Befitting an undergraduate institution with a mission to reshape engineering education – and given the lack of graduate students – Olin offered many opportunities for students to substantively educate each other in various formal and informal ways.

### Olin.js

I joined a student teaching team to give the second offering of [Olin.js](https://github.com/olinjs/olinjs), a semester long for-credit course on full stack web development (in [node.js](https://nodejs.org/en/)). We created all the course materials and ran everything – we gave lectures, graded assignments, held office hours, etc.

Our ~25 students (fellow Olin College students) started the semester with some programming experience, but little to no web experience. By the end of the semester, they were working in teams building real web apps using frameworks like [Angular](https://angularjs.org), [Ember](https://emberjs.com), and [React](https://reactjs.org) (all popular in 2015).

### Practical Electrical Engineering

During my senior year, I wanted to transfer some of the electrical engineering knowledge and practices I had gained from my time as a course assistant and in industry.

I led a small course attended by first- and second-year students covering best practices for solderless breadboards, lab equipment use (oscilloscopes and signal generators), op-amp circuits, and transistor basics.

Some of the course materials are still hosted [here](https://www.evandors.ky/ee-seminar){:.key-phrase}.

### Course Assistant

Throughout my time at Olin College I served as a "NINJA" (**N**eed **I**nformation **N**ow? **J**ust **A**sk! – Olin's term for course assistants) for introductory electrical engineering courses:

- Modeling and Control - circuits
- Real World Measurements - circuits for sensors
- Introduction to Sensors, Instrumentation, and Measurement

and more advanced courses:
- Principles of Engineering – mechatronic systems design and integration
- Controls – dynamic feedback control theory

As a NINJA I graded assignments, held office hours (which were generally well attended at Olin), and gave the occasional lecture. When class time was devoted to open work time, I was often available to answer questions. Olin has no graduate students, so NINJAs work closely with professors to ensure students have the resources they need to succeed.
