*My team*{:.drop-cap}
designed hardware integrating the novel [FastCap](https://www.fastcapultracapacitors.com) ultracapacitors into various application systems.

*My work*{:.drop-cap}
was primarily to improve on an existing design for a mechanical energy harvester. I hardened the prototype – selecting electrical components that would survive extreme shock, vibration, and temperature – and designed a custom printed circuit board (PCB, schematic + layout) that met the project's tight space constraints. I also worked with mechanical engineers to optimize the enclosure size. Between performance improvements and size reductions, the functional prototype we delivered was 10x as energy dense as the proof-of-concept.

 As an intern, I also took care of a lot of odd jobs. I
 - Installed thermal test equipment and ran tests on other systems, collected and analyzed thermal data and presented results to the team
 - Wrote lab equipment drivers to automate tests
 - Designed a "breakout board" for our compact circuit boards to improve the test flow
