We found Ginza substantially less approachable than the other Tokyo neighborhoods we spent time in. It was mostly highrises and department stores – we couldn't even find a Lawson or Seven Eleven at street level.

Next to Ginza is Yurakucho, with yakitori alleys not so different from Omoide Yokocho – this time under the train tracks instead of next to them.

The grills filled this covered alley with smoke.

The streets around the alley were sparsely populated but lively.

Neighboring Ginza was on display, at a safe distance.

This was the densest alley we explored, full of restaurants and activity. We didn't spot many foreigners here.

We ended the night at a tiny, very dark jazz bar between Ginza and Yurakucho. Like many spots in Tokyo, it was playing exclusively relaxed American country music. And the bartender was warm and accommodating despite the language barrier.
